 Assignment 2 for Interactive Development

## Overall concept
Our aim is to encourage users to gain more knowledge by taking quizzes in a fun and exciting manner. A website where users are able to sign up for an account and earn points to purchase cosemetic items from a shop. Quizzes are sorted into categories and give different points according to the difficulty as well as the time taken to complete the quiz. A leaderboard is assigned to each quiz and showcases the fastest user to complete it.

## Design Process
This website will be aimed at people that want to take quizzes during their free time, to grow their knowledge and relieve stress with some fun quizzes! It will encourage users by adding gamification elements to our website.

User stories:
- As a new person, I would like to be able to sign in to the website and create an account to be able to earn points from solving quizzes and use them to get exciting prizes.

- As a person that already has an account, I would like to be able to log in to the website from a different device.
